# Documentation

1. Created a new repository on GitHub to test this whole VSTS integrated PR deal.
2. Created the default .NET Core console app project in Visual Studio which runs "Hello World" and committed it to the repository.
3. Since this test repository will not be doing internal builds (only PR and CI), we will not be creating a VSTS mirror of the repository.
